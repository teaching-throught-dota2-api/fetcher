use this as a starting point to get the limitations of the api i want to know everything about when it updates and how it updates.
you can use console.log() function to output your result instead of the data itself. For example you can check how long we have to wait so the data does not repeats by comparing the previous result with the one just reseved using the array.every() function https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every instead of array.filter() and output using console.log to the screen if every element is the same. this means we will need another array that simply storres the previous values similer to how json_data_cache stores all the values.
