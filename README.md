Use this as a starting point to get the limitations of the api. I want to know everything about when it updates and how it updates.
you can use console.log() function to output your result instead of the data itself this is what the example currently shows. For example you can check how long we have to wait so the data does not repeats by comparing the previous result with the one just reseved using the [array.every()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) function instead of [array.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and output using console.log to the screen to see the result. This means we will need another array that simply stores the previous run values similer to how json_data_cache stores all the values currently.
